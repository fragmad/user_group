  <summary>Level 1 - Password Strength Rater</summary>
  
  ## Password Strength Rater
  
  In this puzzle we will build a password strength rater. The exercise is split into steps, with some links to tips which will be useful if you are just getting started!
  
  ### Writing a Python Function

Write a function which takes as arguments, the user's `username` and `password` and gives a score to their password.

To start with we can just return a score of `0`.

    def rate_password(username, password):
        score = 0
        return score

Now check to see if your function works, at the moment it should always return `0`. Below, the part next to the `>>>` indicated the function call to make, and the line below indicates the expected output.

    >>> rate_password('bob', 'python')
    0

  ### Rating Password Length

To start with, give the user 1 point for each character in the length of the password.

|  Criteria                                                   | Score                     |
| :---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------: |
| Score given for length                                      |  + 1 point per character  |

Example usage:

    >>> rate_password('bob', '')
    0

    >>> rate_password('bob', 'a')
    1

    >>> rate_password('bob', 'python')
    6

### Rating Character Types

Now we want to give extra points if the password contains certain types of characters. 3 points is it contains a-z, 3 points for A-Z, and 5 points for 0-9.

Remember to add all of these togethor with the length score!

For example, `Pass42word` contains 10 characters (a score of 10), plus 2 (for a-z), plus 3 (for A-Z), plus 5 (for 0-9), giving 20 points.

A password will be graded using the following criteria:

|  Criteria                                                   | Score                     |
| :---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------: |
| Score given for length                                      |  + 1 point per character  |
| Contains at least 1 lower-case letter (a-z)                 |  + 2 points               |
| Contains at least 1 upper-case letter (A-Z)                 |  + 3 points               |
| Contains at least 1 digit (0-9)                             |  + 5 points               |

    >>> rate_password('bob', 'Pass42word')
    20
    
    >>> rate_password('bob', 'pass42word')
    17
    
    >>> rate_password('bob', '12345')
    5

Try writing some other test cases to check your function works.

### More Characters

Next, lets add for more character checks.

If the password contains any spaces, give 5 extra points, and any characters **not** in a-z, A-Z, or 0-9, or spaced, give an extra 10 points.

|  Criteria                                                   | Score                     |
| :---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------: |
| Score given for length                                      |  + 1 point per character  |
| Contains at least 1 lower-case letter (a-z)                 |  + 2 points               |
| Contains at least 1 upper-case letter (A-Z)                 |  + 3 points               |
| Contains at least 1 digit (0-9)                             |  + 5 points               |
| Contains a space                                            |  + 5 points               |
| Contains any other character                                |  + 10 points              |

This password gets 10 points for containing a character not listed above (plus 9 for length)

    >>> rate_password('bob', 'おはようございます')
    19

This one get's 5 points for having at least one space (plus remember the other critera)

    >>> rate_password('bob', 'Bob cat 猫')
    29
    
### Penalty

Finally, let's add a penalty for including the username in the password. If the pasword contians the username (even in a different casing) the score loses 15 points!

|  Criteria                                                   | Score                     |
| :---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------: |
| Score given for length                                      |  + 1 point per character  |
| Contains at least 1 lower-case letter (a-z)                 |  + 2 points               |
| Contains at least 1 upper-case letter (A-Z)                 |  + 3 points               |
| Contains at least 1 digit (0-9)                             |  + 5 points               |
| Contains a space                                            |  + 5 points               |
| Contains any other character                                |  + 10 points              |
| Contains username (case-insensitive)                        |  - 15 points              |
| Minimum score                                               |     0 points              |

    >>> rate_password('bob', 'BoX cat 猫')
    29
    
    >>> rate_password('bob', 'BoB cat 猫')
    14

Limit the minimum score to 0, so under the other rules, this would get a score of 3+2-15 = -10, but we want to scores to start at 0. So any negative score turns into 0.

    >>> rate_password('bob', 'bob')
    0

    >>> rate_password('bob', 'bobbobbobbob')
    0

    >>> rate_password('bob', 'bobbobbobbobbob')
    2

  <summary>Level 2 - Russian Multiplication</summary>
  
  ## Russian Multiplication
  
  The problem requires you to implement an unusal multiplication algorithm for positive integers.
  
  Let's mulitply **42 × 1337**. But instead of using normal mulitplication, we will use a method which only uses halving, doubling, and addition!

First, we write the two numbers **a** and **b** in a table (which is which doesn't matter because a×b is the same as b×a, but you'll see it's faster if we put the smaller number on the left).

|  a |     b |
| -: | ----: |
| 42 |  1337 |

Now we complete the first column by halving **a** on each line. 42 halves to give 21. 21 halves to give 10 (don't worry about the fraction part). 10 halves to give 5. 5 halves to give 2 (don't worry about the fraction part). 2 halves to give 1. Now we stop at 1.

|  a |     b |
| -: | ----: |
| 42 |  1337 |
| 21 |       |
| 10 |       |
|  5 |       |
|  2 |       |
|  1 |       |

Since we kept halving **a**, we should double **b** the same number of times. Since we're doubling, no need to worry about any fractions, just double as you normally would.

|  a |     b |
| -: | ----: |
| 42 |  1337 |
| 21 |  2674 |
| 10 |  5348 |
|  5 | 10696 |
|  2 | 21392 |
|  1 | 42784 |

Next, we delete any rows where **a** is even, like the rows where **a** is 42, 10, or 2.

|  a |     b |
| -: | ----: |
| 21 |  2674 |
|  5 | 10696 |
|  1 | 42784 |

And lastly, we add up the **b** column: 2674 + 10696 + 42784 = 56154.

And if you check, magically your origonal two numbers muliutply to give the same number! 42 × 1337 = 56154

Write a Python function to do this proceedure.

Example usage:

    >>> russian_multiplication(42, 1337):
    56154

You may want to try other pairs of positive integers to make sure it works.

If you have time, try writing your tests as unit tests.

  <summary>Level 3 - The Frog Problem</summary>
  
  ## The Frog Problem
  
This problem requires you to write a simulation of a system involving randomness.

A frog wants to get from it's current lily pad (pad `0`) to another lily pad `n` pads are (pad `n`)

For example, if `n=4`, there are 5 total pads (0 to 4).

![frog1.png](frog1.png)

The frog can hop as far as it wants in a single bound! But it likes to randomly choose any of the lily pads in front of it (with equal probability) and hop to that one.

![frog2.png](frog2.png)

Once hopped, it again, randomly chooses any of the lily pads in front of it (with equal probability) and hops to that.

![frog3.png](frog3.png)

When it reaches lily pad `n` (in this case 4), the frog is home.

The frog can take in total anywhere between 1 and n hops to get home.

First, write a function which simulates the frog's journey once. The parameter `n` is the distance the frog has to travel (1 less than the number of pads).

**Since it is random, it will vary from run-to-run!!!**

Example usage:

    >>> simulate_frog(4):
    2

    >>> simulate_frog(4):
    2

    >>> simulate_frog(4):
    1

    >>> simulate_frog(4):
    3

Next, add a named parenter which allows your function to repeate the simulation many times and return the average (mean) number of hops the journey took.

    >>> simulate_frog(4, simulations=1000000):
    2.082791

The answer will vary, but you should get around `2.08` for `n=4`.

Fill in the table with the results from your simulation, and try to find a pattern.

| n         | Average Number of Hops |
| --------: | ---------------------: |
| 0         | 0 |
| 1         | 1 |
| 2         | ... |
| 3         | ... |
| 4         | ~ 2.08 |
| 5         | ... |
| ... | ... |

Work out how many hops it will take on average for `n = 1,000,000` (Hint: compare each entry in the table above to the previous row to work out a formula)

Use a plotting library to generate a plot with `n` on the x-axis and Average number of hops on the y-axis. Try plotting on the smae chart, both your simulation results, and prediction for an explicit formula and see how they match up!
